		<p>GTW stands for Get To Work Inc., an organization founded and geared toward saving and empowering the youth of tomorrow,
		that are being lost to the streets of yesterday and today.</p> 
		<p>Showing that through community engagement and rendezvous spirit change can come.</p>
		<p>Ms. Edie Jacobs is the owner and founder of GTW.</p>
		<p>Her mission is to provide jobs and transportation to underprivileged areas in the city of Chicago,
		in an attempt to help teens, young adults, and even ex-offenders establish themselves in communities through the work,
		housing and other industries while providing a better quality of life.</p>
		<p>Ms. Jacobs is a retired 30 year veteran officer of the Department of Corrections and a long time Community leader.</p>
		<p>For the past 5 years she has had a vision to assist in the revitalization of poverty stricken neighborhoods in the city of Chicago through 
		helping teens and young adults with re-entering the community through the work force with the relationships that she has built with various
		human resource departments in different hiring agencies and companies.</p>
		<p>She has collaborated with employers and job development centers and provided occupational resources to them, while providing
		 assistance with daily operations, interview review, and employment orientation.</p>
		<p>She has ensured the proper rules and regulations are followed by the candidates she places with the companies she works with.</p> 
		<p>She has followed this process through the prescreening of candidates, providing counseling and necessary assistance to make sure 
		that candidates are ready to GTW-(Get To Work).</p>
		<p>The inspiration behind Ms. Jacob's philanthropy was born over the frustration of her son's inability to find adequate local employment.</p> 
		<p>She turned this frustration around and was able to build great work relationships with companies such as Handi-Foil, Richelieu, and Green Core.</p> 
		<p>She hopes to continue her mission and vision with other companies in the same fashion. The targeted areas that she has specialized in and has been Austin,
		 North Lawndale, Garfield Park, Tri-Taylor, and Englewood.</p>
